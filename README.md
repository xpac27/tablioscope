# Tablioscope

Single-page score viewer, [try it live](https://xpac27.github.io/tablioscope/).

Loads a file from your machine and renders it in the browser using [AlphaTab](https://www.alphatab.net/). The page is geared for quick inspection of exported tabs and scores without installing a full editor.

## Usage

Run the cucumber tests:

```bash
bundle exec cucumber

## Extras folder

`extras/` contains the Ruby conversion scripts and small helpers used for local format experiments. These are optional for the web viewer and can be run directly from the command line if you want to generate or inspect output in the terminal.
